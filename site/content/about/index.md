I am a software engineer living and working in Ann Arbor, MI. I work on large, complex web apps built with Ruby on Rails and Ember. I am the Director of Engineering for [Trice Imaging](https://triceimaging.com) and one of the co-owners of [Workantile](http://workantile.org), a coworking community in downtown Ann Arbor.

I love travel. I have traveled extensively throughout the US and Canada, and have visited England, Wales, Scotland, Iceland, France, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Spain, and Portugal. Prague is the most beautiful city I have visited, and Barcelona the most interesting.

Music keeps me sane. I am a baritone with [Vanguard Voices](http://vanguardvoices.org) and the [Aeolian Chorale](https://www.facebook.com/aeolianchorale). I have had the privilege of performing, among many other things, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Mass in B-Minor by JS Bach, and Maurice Durufl√®'s setting of the Requiem Mass.

Other interests include reading, and the art of the craft cocktail. My current reading interests include mystery (Louise Penney and Reginald Hill are current favorites), and speculative fiction (JRR Tolkien, NK Jemison).

I am an elder in the [Presbyterian Church (USA)](https://www.pcusa.org/) and an active member of the [First Presbyterian Church of Ann Arbor](https://firstpresbyterian.org).
